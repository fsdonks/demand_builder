Format: 
All input files have to be formatted as tab delimited .txt files
Scripts assumes files have the following naming conventions:
Vignette Map: MAP_filename
Vignette Consolidated: CONSOLIDATED_filename
For Each File: FORGE_[FC], where [FC] is the value for the first entry in Vignette map. 

Scenarios have to be have the label SE as force code id prefix
Force code prefixes that start with 'V-' 'S-' or 'H ... -' will have data read from CONSOLIDATED file.

Note: quantity in Vignette map is never used,
      quantity values from either Forge file or Consolidated file

Script assumes there is only one map and one consolidated file in root directory.
If there are more than one, only the first one will be used.

To run, use ->demand-file function to run. When a single path or a collection passed in as arguments,
Creates demand files for each path. 

When no argument passed in, opens GUI to select path/paths (can select multiple paths)
